                  This ghost guy was made in blender with the Lightning Boy Shader add on for shading.
                  He was designed and modeled by me.
                  The mouth uses shape keys and a boolean to get interesting results fast.
                  The rig was primaraly for learning shape keys and it turned out to be very succesful.

                  This Kidd character was designed for a game concept.
                  She was modeled following good modeling techniques for animation.
                  Current plans for her are to finish facial rigging, make some animations and possibly import her into a game engine.

                Rubberhose Style Pig
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This is a model of a pig made in Blender inspired by the “rubber hose era” of animation. 
                  This model also uses the Lightning Boy Shader just like the Ghost Guy. I designed my models to be fully rigged even 
                  though they need some additional work to be exported out of Blender. The box at the side is a 
                  screenshot of the objects and some of the bones in the scene to show what it took to create the final product.

                About Me
              </h1>
              <p>
                My name is Zachary Miller and I am in a carleton univercitys  because I am interested in 3d modeling, programming and game design as a career. 
                This course is exactly what I want to explore to expand my education and is the best way to learn and develop my skills within this field. 
                Up to this point, I have mainly been using Blender to make 3d models and I personally think that I have gotten a good start at understanding the basics of the program. 
                I have been taking programming classes in high school and have realized this is where my interests lie.
                During my time in high school I have completed 2 years of the Technological Design course.
                This has given me knowledge and experience in programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and AutoCAD.
